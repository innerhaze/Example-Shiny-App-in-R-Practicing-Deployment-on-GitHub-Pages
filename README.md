# Shiny Live Demo Example

This repository contains a demonstration of a Shiny app using the `shinylive` package, deployed via GitHub Pages. The example showcases a basic Shiny app that generates a histogram with interactive features.

**Please note:** The Shiny script used in this example is not original to this repository. It was sourced from another GitHub user named 'coatless' for practice purposes. The main objective of this repository is to practice deploying Shiny applications to GitHub Pages.

## Files Included
- `_quarto.yml`: Configuration file for Quarto.
- `R-shinylive-demo.qmd`: Quarto document that includes the Shiny app code.
- `R-shinylive-demo.html`: Rendered HTML document of the Quarto file.
- `shinylive-sw.js`: Service worker file for `shinylive`.
- `_extensions/quarto-ext/shinylive`: Directory for `shinylive` extension files.
